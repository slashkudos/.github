## How It Works

### Giving Kudos

Kudos will be integrated into the apps you already know and love, so no need to learn something new. In Discord, GitHub, Teams, and Slack where the /Kudos is installed, just type `/kudos @user your message here...` to give Kudos.

Twitter works a bit differently - just Tweet [@slashkudos][Kudos Twitter] where you would normally use `/Kudos`. So something like `@slashkudos @user your message here...`.

### Exploring Kudos

After rolling out integrations to several of the [apps we plan to support](#supported-apps), we will provide a central place to view all your Kudos on app.slashkudos.com. This is where you will be able to:

- View Kudos you have received
- View Kudos you have given
- View a universal feed of Kudos

## Supported Apps

I am planning on building integrations for giving kudos from these apps. If you want me to create an integration for one not on here, or you want to help create an integration, please create an issue in this repo.

```
- Discord
- GitHub
- Microsoft Teams
- Slack
- Twitter
```

## Features

Features will be rolled out in a series of phases. At a high-level, we will focus on setting up the proper integrations to give and receive Kudos on the most popular apps first. Then we will focus on the exploration and reporting piece on app.slashkudos.com.

See [The Slash Kudos Project](https://github.com/orgs/slashkudos/projects/1/views/1) for a more in-depth plan.
