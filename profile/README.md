## How It Works

### Giving Kudos

slashkudos integrates into the apps you already know and love, so no need to learn something new. In Discord, GitHub, Teams, and Slack where the slashkudos app is installed, just type `/kudos @user your message here...` to give kudos.

Twitter works a bit differently - just Tweet [@slashkudos][slashkudos Twitter]. For example, tweet `For example, tweet ‚Äú@slashkudos Thanks @philipgai_dev for making me! üöÄ‚Äù`.

### Exploring Kudos

Visit [app.slashkudos.com] where you can:

- View kudos you have received
- View kudos you have given
- View a universal feed of kudos

## Supported Apps

We are planning on building integrations for giving kudos from these apps. If you want me to create an integration for one not on here, or you want to help create an integration, please [create an issue](https://github.com/slashkudos/slashkudos/issues/new) in [slashkudos/slashkudos].

## Project Roadmap

Features will be rolled out in a series of phases. At a high-level, we will focus on setting up the proper integrations to give and receive kudos on the most popular apps first. Then we will focus on the exploration and reporting piece on app.slashkudos.com.

See [The slashkudos Project](https://github.com/orgs/slashkudos/projects/1/views/1) for a more in-depth plan.
